# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Overview 
This project is a climate analysis and API development task aimed at helping with trip planning for a vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. Using historical climate data, I analyze precipitation and temperature trends, then deploy a Flask API to provide insights based on these analyses.


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **SQL**: Used for querying, manipulating, and analyzing data within the database.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight and self-contained SQL database engine used for data storage, providing a reliable and efficient way to store and manage data.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library that provides tools to work with databases using Python objects, making data querying and manipulation more flexible and Pythonic.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for building the API endpoints that allows easy routing and JSON responses, making it suitable for small to medium-scale web applications.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.
